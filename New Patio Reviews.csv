4,4,"Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.",4,Great Hoses
0,0,This is a high quality 8 ply hose. I have had good luck with Gilmour hoses in the past. A good choice in hoses.,5,"Gilmour 10-58050 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch by 50-Foot, Green"
2,3,"It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!",4,Very satisfied!
0,0,"I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.",5,Very high quality
1,1,"I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.",5,Good Hoses
0,0,"I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks",5,GGGGGGGGREAT
1,1,"After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2"" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8"", but this is 3/4"".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4"" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2"" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.",5,More powerful water flow
0,0,This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.,5,WOW This Is Tough

0,0,So far so good! I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now. I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations. I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.,4,Flexible hose as marketed....hope it lives up to the hipe!
0,0,Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses. You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..  But I am only giving you 4 stars  because this hose and the 100 footer I bought  a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?,4,have you changed the rubber formula ????

0,0,I bought a cheap hose that didn't hold the pressure after 2 days.  This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.,5,This hose holds the pressure
1,1,"I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.  I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.  slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.  I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me",5,Just as hoped
4,4,"For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.  They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.  This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.  It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.  Quite a company!",5,Gilmour makes great products
2,2,"It's been outside in the hot (South Florida) sunshine 24/7, and still flexible. No crackles, and remains in great shape!A real bargain!",5,Been using it happily for over a year now!
1,2,"I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.  I don't do much in the way of gardening, nor wash my car that often.  So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )",5,Great Hose...Decent Price
80,81,"I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a ""brake"" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)",5,Landscaper Approved!
1,1,This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.

0,0,"There is only one thing wrong with this design:  the spray shape and the water volume can not be controlled independently. Better designs have one control for open-closed and another for spray shape. That makes this nozzle useless for filling buckets and other close applications. It is impossible to get high volume at low pressure output.That said, the simple design is almost bomb-proof and the price is fair.",4,standard product

This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.",5,Never thought it was possible to love a hose nozzle!

0,0,I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.,5,Nozzle
0,0,"This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly –e.g., it's not an even ""circle"" of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.",4,Simple... sturdy... inexpensive...
111,114,"Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get ""prettier"" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if ""pretty"" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a ""lock on"" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no ""medium"" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual ""problem"", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is ""too good""---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a ""closed"" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then ""open 'er up"" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT ""Gilmour 572TF"".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in ""bargain bin"" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a ""Gilmour 572TF"", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the ""Gilmour 572TF"", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those ""prettier"" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in ""bargain bins"", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a ""pretty"" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will ""sacrifice"" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) ""pretty"" sprayer nozzles, which have ""fallen out of favor"" for various reasons.",5,Does the Job

It killed me to spend so much on a sprinkler, but I've probably sunk so much on junk sprinklers in the past 10 years and bit the bullet after reading the reviews for the Raintrain. Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation. My lawn really looks better than it had when I used my old sprinkler.I use this in my garden  and it does a good job keeping all my perennials and herbs staying healthy and lush.This sprinkler is well made and worth the higher than average price.",4,A Cinch To Operate
1,1,"There are some positive features about the Nelson Raintree Traveling Sprinkler that makes is an excellent sprinkler, and a good one to have if one has a large lawn. It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a ""traveling"" sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it.",4,Sturdily built
365,406,"I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, ""sprinkler watching"" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on ""low gear,"" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the ""nose"" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain ""jump the track.""  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.",3,"Fun and functional, but a lot of work"
0,0,"This looks like it will be a great piece of equipment.  I've used it a couple of times so far and have been impressed.

It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving.",4,Works as advertised

I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase",3,Close but no Cigar
0,0,"I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.",2,Disappointing
135,142,"After hearing so much about this unit, and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood, I decided to give it a try, even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler.I now know why so many  people like it.  It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!",5,Flexible and effective way to water your lawn
1,2,"Update/Tip: The way our yard is this shoots too large of a swath so I went to Lowes and got a 3 foot piece of 1/2 inch aluminum pipe and made some new arms. I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment.",5,Works great but will it last
2,2,"I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12"" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement.",5,I love my Rain Train!
16,24,"It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one.",3,"hmmm, not the best hose in the world"

I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty, but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.

2,2,"Short review:  This hose is amazing, Made in the USA, tough as nails yet flexible, will not kink EVER, and I love it.  Buy it now.Longer review:I bought a home depot memorial day special hose for $19.95 (same size as this one) and thought ""how different can hoses be?  this one says kink free.""  Three months of hose torture ensued, with me trying various tactics (e.g. only moving hose when it's pressurized) to try to keep it from kinking.  That damn endless kink hose is now in a pile in a garage ready for donation.  It has more kinks in it than a Russian porn movie.  Every time I used it I became more and more frustrated and thought longingly of this twice the price hose.Take my advice, buy this hose, it is worth it.  It's also nice to see it's Made in the USA - at least something is.  Amazing warranty. Even in cooler weather it stays flexible.  Great brass fittings.  They are right, this is the last hose I'll ever buy.  Please, Gilmour, don't try to save on cost in the future - keep this hose just the way it is!Hope this helps.

0,0,I thought I had already reviewed this hose.  We love it!  It is strong and it attaches easily and smoothly to each other (we bought TWO 100' lengths) without leaking.  I expect these hoses to last us a terrifically long time.,5,Strong and durable
12,12,"UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no ""waves"" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a ""lightweight"" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a ""no-kink"" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality.",1,UPDATE:  Kinks Easily & Difficult to Handle

After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - ""Flexogen"". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say ""This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee"". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package.

Usually I do it every other time. The first time out after a long winter, edging usually takes a little longer. After that, edging is a snap because you are basically in maintanence mode.I also use this around my landscaping and flower beds with equally great results.The blade on the Edge Hog is easily replaceable and the tell tale sign to replace it is when the edge starts to look a little rough and the machine seems slower.",5,Big Timesaver

Instead I now get a nice clean ""professional"" edge. Finally! And my back is so much happier!! The price on this product is competitive with other retailers.

0,0,"I had a previous Edge-Hog for a little more than 8 years when the motor brushes finally wore out.  I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a ""swing open"" cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one.",5,Had to replace my eight year old model

We have St. Augustine grass here in Florida.  It propagates by spreading tough, vine-like runners.  I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.  This edger cut right through them, which I didn't expect, given the toughness of the grass.  But it never hesitated, except on some very stuborn growth.  I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.  I never felt like this edger had taken control and gone where I didn't want it to go.  Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.

No matter how much care one took with the hand-winding, the line always broke off prematurely -- from having gotten jammed up.  I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.

FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap(s) I'd been using to great effect. I did my research on Amazon and Flowtron was the hands-down winner. Although our entire lot is only 2000sf, I decided to spend the extra few dollars on the 1-acre model.It seems to work well, because I hear the thing buzzing all night long, and the housing definitely leaves a lot of space for insects to get in--one morning I found a praying mantis stuck in it. My major insect concern, though, was flies, and because they're only active during the day, the Flowtron is moot. And I was really looking forward to seeing some of those biting flies get their just deserts. If the mosquitos are getting theirs, maybe the ants are hauling the corpses away before I can do a body count.So what insect population am I decimating? Moths, evidently.

It utilze's an arc of electricity to kill the insects that are unlucky enough to go to the light.  There are verticle bars surrounding the lamp that when a insect touches two of the bars, the flowtron utilizes the insect to complete the circuit until there isn't sufficient insect left (burnt up) to continue the arc.  Generally this is a fairly quick process (ZAP) however the occasional moth or larger bug will fly in and you'll hear a nice zaaaaaaaap or sizzzzzzzle until enough is ""gone"" to break the arc.Maybe it's morbid - I enjoy hearing the zap and the occasional sizzzzzzzzle because that is one less nusuance bug to bite my family, my guests or my dog.

I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48"" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement!

I was pruning deadwood inside a hedge with little clearance for the handles, so the jaws were not fully open and the cuts were being made near the tip of the blade and anvil.  User error.  Not only did the pruner cut poorly in this position, but also the blade tended to twist.  Finally I figured out this pruner comes into its own when cutting deep in the V.  That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.

So I had to pursue a different path to keep the cats out.I did, however, keep using this material to keep birds and other unwanted pests (moths, butterflies, etc.) out of my garden.  Having another pair of hands around to help with installation is good because this material tangles easily and snags on just about everything, including itself.  So you need to exercise care when putting it on otherwise it will rip.  I also realized after a few months of use that the mesh size is too large so moths and butterflies can easily squeeze themselves through the netting and make their way to the plants.For the price, it's a decent product.

I'm a 4'10"" disabled woman with bad knees and a bad back. I just don't have the upper body strength to ram a post-hole digger into the clay soil in our fescue-matted field, and the two big, strong men in my household always have something more pressing to do.I discovered the Garden Claw makes a circular hole that's just a tad wider than the post-hole digger does, and I can loosen six or more inches of clay soil and roots in no time. Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I've been frustrated because I've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it.

0,0,"I bought my garden claw several years ago. I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern.",4,A Tool That Really Helps Get it Done

But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to ""steer"" the Claw to the left to get them to dig.

0,0,"A couple of years ago my husband decided to shove our old mower in the shed and buy this push mower with the sharpening kit and grass catcher. His motivation was that this mower would not pollute and was ecologically responsible.While it isn't hard to maintain or use and it can be adjusted for height easily, I am a finicky type and I really don't care for the job this mower does. I miss the good old days when my lawn looked perfectly manicured with neat paths of freshly mowed grass.The positive in regard to this mower is that it cuts a wide path which theoretically is time saving and efficient. The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the lawn's overall appearance.This is a cheap mower. It might be great for someone who has a small yard, but my yard isn't small. This mower Isn't even close to my grandpa's old push mower that really tamed an unruly lawn and was solid.  Last night I had to order a new handle and another sharpening kit.Today I am going to buy a nice power driven Toro and I'll mow the lawn from now on.",3,Nothing To Brag About
166,176,"Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more ""finished"" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these.",5,You gotta try this!
2,2,"It's a classic all right, but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.

2,2,"I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I'm going green... well I'm not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We'll probably end up welding it together so it doesn't wobble.All said and done it's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20"" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we'll see.Wobbly handle.",5,"Not going green, just saving gas money..."
3,3,"I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty.",5,"Great mower, lousy handle"

With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great!

1,1,"I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores ""inconvenient truth"" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now ""running like a champ"".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the ""high spots"".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better.",4,Good Choice......But only if you have the time to mow more often

The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me.",1,Broke on Second Use
2,2,"I ordered my Scotts 20"" Classic Mower on Earth Day and because I had to put it together, I finally used it for the first time in mid-May. I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing.",4,Little Green Mower
3,3,"I was not sure if this mower would work for me, seeing as my lawn is ""too big"", bumpy, and pretty weedy as I don't use chemicals on it.  But I took the chance and am very glad I did.  It's much easier to manage than the gas mower I was using (not self propelled),  and does a good job on the lawn.  If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each ""section"" of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.  Using this mower might take me a bit longer than using the gas powered one, but not by much.  And it's a whole lot quieter and easier to maintain.",5,Love it!
87,93,"I am a great fan of manual mowers for small yards, although that wasn't always the case. When I was a small lad one fo my shores was to mow a double lot with an old, heavy manual mower, something that soured me on manual mowers for decades. But a few years ago I discovered the new generation of manual mowers, and now I mow my lawn in about the time it took with my gas mower, but without the noise, the vibrations or the fumes. I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand. And get a can of Boeshield protectant spray (also available from Amazon). A quick once over with the Boeshield from time to time will greatly extend the life of your mower and keep it easy to push.",5,The Second Best Machine Available
0,0,"I have about six-thousand square feet of lawn.  This mower handles it quite well.  There's some effort to push it, but it's actually easier in some ways than using a power mower; for example, the lighter weight of this mower makes it far easier to change directions in a tight space.  It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower.",4,"Well-Designed, Well-Made Mower"

2,2,"I love push mowers - quiet and when the blades are sharp, they do a great job. This goes for this mower, too. It is ideal if you have a small lawn or want to get a little exercise while mowing. The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem. This has nothing to do with the mower itself, just know that before you buy it, research your area to make sure there is someone who can sharpen it for you.",3,Good reel mower

We have a relatively small yard, so the 14 inch width is completely appropriate.  I also was super impressed at the way it handled long grass.  I know these mowers are notorious for not being able to handle it, but I was pretty pleased.  It may not have cut the long grass like a gas mower, but it really was completely acceptable.  Like a few other reviewers have said it does get stuck on any little twig.  So you might have to stop a few times to bend over and pick them out, but if you're the reel mower type I would assume bending over a few times isn't out of the question.

I did what it said, and alas I have (some) morning glorys in addition to some basil and cilantro seeds I had sitting around.  I had average sprouting, but I would always attribute that to the seeds more than the plastic trays!I did feel that the plastic cover is VERY flimsy, it actually doesn't fit on the top very well.  I suppose its not that big of a deal because the top isn't really on very long, but I would have appreciated it being a little more sturdy.The bottom tray is a bit more robust and I haven't had any issues as I've moved the full tray a few times.So far its served its purpose, but now as I've done it once I might look around for some different/better options in the future.

21,23,"I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the ""Jiffy 5777"" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season.",5,Works great (but some confusion with refill sizes)

0,0,"Recently I've been researching mice and other vermin as they pertain to farmstead habitation.Knowing that they must be removed from chicken coops and feed storage areas, it's nice to have options that do not require poison, nor snap a mouse/vole/rat to death and leave it for animals to pick at and possibly get sick from.Your cat, dog and other pets may get access to dead animals in traditional traps, so these enclosed live catch traps seemed like a great idea.I purchased four and placed them on a shelf where mouse droppings were noted.  I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better.",3,Mice trip Kness Tip-Trap by walking ON it... flawed by design

A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes.",3,This is why the reviews aren't great

Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.

Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = ""far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user"") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.

1,1,"I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives, they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway, I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it, then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet, ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again, still upside down, and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap.",5,Very good feeder
2,2,,5,Another recommended Hummingbird Feeder
2,2,"We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock ""hummingbird wars"".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.",3,A tiny gripe - why change what was working?
1,1,"I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",5,Finally a sturdy feeder that doesn't leak and keeps bees away(5- stars)
0,0,I am using this with the Audubon Hummingbird Food packets. It is easy to assemble and disassemble for cleaning.

0,0,"July 28, 2012 Update""Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.",5,Ask the Hummers; Not Me
1,1,"I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd...",5,Excellent design and great value

But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow ""bee guards."" Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these ""bee guards"" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again.",2,Feeder is fine - bee guards have bad design

2,2,"It's spring and time to bring out the hummingbird feeder.  This is one of the most popular models and there are lots of reasons.  It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions.",5,Use This & Plants To Bring In A Flock!

Once in a while, the bee guards have dropped out (and customarily I located them again.)  The last time I didn’t.  Long story, irrelevant to the product review, I just realize.  Be it as it may, I have no issues with the bee guards, nor (more importantly) do the hummingbirds.  This past season, the guards functioned flawlessly, to the delight of our hummingbird population (and frustration of the yellow-jackets.)

Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.  When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well.",4,Bees Be Gone but not quite

After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren't as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4"" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you're brushing it.

End product is satisfactory. Why do they call it the Smokey Joe Silver when it is black? Poor choice of names.,4,Satisfactory
1,1,"Ive had this same grill for about 8 years now and its as nice now as the day I got it. Its big enough to cook pretty much whatever you need to cook on it, of course if you have a lot to cook it may take a little longer. Ive always had everything cook very evenly with more than sufficient burn time with coals. This grill is also small enough that you can take it with you for camping or going on your boat for a bbq on the beach (I just use a bungy cord to secure the lid) . If I need to rid of the coals I just put water on them turn the grill upside down and cover the coals in dirt, if the grill is still hot ill throw some more water on it then wipe it down and off we go..This grill isnt heavy so you can easily dump out the ashes in your trash can or where ever with minimal effort. Very great grill for the price and perfect for pretty much anyone!",5,Perfect little grill
4,7,"I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992.  I am finally replacing him... not because he wore out, but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important.  (It's a long story... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car).  Anyway, I am now replacing my first SJ with another.  I'm quite certain he will be chillin' and grillin' with me for the rest of my life.",5,Smokey Joe Smokes!
27,30,"The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!",4,Great portable grill with a few caveats
0,0,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills… and that’s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill… there’s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around…once lit this unit isn’t going anywhere. Also, there’s no place to put the lid once it’s removed… the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that… it’s a perfect grill for the two of us, it’s easy to assemble, it’s built rugged and it’s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle… when it’s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you’re good to go.",5,Not quite like its bigger brother.
9,9,"Hurricane Irene was on its way and our gas grill was DOA. Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too.",5,"No power, no stove, Little Weber Grill kept us fed for a week !!"
6,7,"Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.",3,OK for what it is
2,2,You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people.,5,Replacement for a 20 year old Smokey Joe
3,4,"Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!",5,Love this grill
8,9,"I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle.",5,"Weber 22.5"" One-Touch Gold Kettle Grill - Awesome!"

So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great.

0,0,"Order this blue grill a week ago and got a defect with 2 big black dent on the side on the cover exposing the inside metal. I was a little disappointed. Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a ""please call me"" service. I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away. The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck.",5,"Beautiful grill, love it"
0,0,"We ordered this for the FIRST time on February 5, 2010.  My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year.",5,Let me Explain
1,1,"I love BBQ. For convenience I have often used a gas grill, but really do love the taste of meat cooked over charcoal (PAH and NCA risks notwithstanding). I have often cooked turkey breasts for Thanksgiving, and particularly love the smokey flavor that comes with it! Alongside baked potatoes and fresh veggies (extra nice on the grill), I have a special meal that is actually healthy.So when my last gas grill bit the dust, we went back to the old fashioned way of cooking! Real charcoal, real delicious smell, real delicious flavor! I suggest that you consider using theWeber 7416 Rapidfire Chimney Starter, so that you can have the purest taste without any chemical oders.A funny thing happened when a dear friend came by to visit ...

1,1,This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.,5,Love this grill!
203,205,"When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1"" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session's grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don't string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don't wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste.",5,Hard to beat
1,1,"I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.

At first I did not like the idea of scraping my nice new grill, which is why I temporarily stumbled on the instructions. They pop in nicely once you get past this. The 3rd leg kind of twirls on which is quite obvious once you start fiddling with it but the instructions have no words so the pictures are not as self-explaintory as I would have hoped in these 2 areas.My only complaints on this grill are the legs and the handle. The legs were wobbly and not as secure as I would have liked them and they were installed all the way to the base of the grill (as the picture showed)  some nuts and bolts would have went far in this area.The handle gets to hot to handle with bare hands. especially when doing large meats like roasts or whole chickens. Wood would have fixed this problem. I wrapped mine with some small rope (not string) and it helped a little.All said and done it's a great grill.

I used the 2-2-1 method on a rack of baby backs and never had to think about adding charcoal over 5 hours. By using the vents you can get wood chips to smolder for an hour and not flare up and burn away in minutes.  The ash pan holds at least three cooks worth of ashes and does not leak.  I feel comfortable cooking on my wooden deck because of the ash pan. The only addition i would make is the Craycort cast iron grate.,5,Great Grill

15,17,"That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years.",5,What a piece of junk! :)

1,1,"After our gas grill had to be retired, we decided to get a charcoal grill.  Weber has a reputation for having a solid product that will last for many years, and I have no doubt that we'll be using this for a long time.  But the legs seem to be made out of somewhat cheaper material than what we had when I was younger. Think I'll be getting the cover to protect it over the winter.This particular model doesn't have the one-touch ash catcher and after using this a few times, I'm kind of sorry we didn't go with that particular model.One person can put it together without help, athough it can be a struggle for a bit.Grilling?

Who wants to put a glove on just to open a grill... this isn't the smartest move unless Weber is attempting to save trees (but they should remember where charcoal comes from).

12,13,"I wish I'd bought one of these the day I first moved out on my own! For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying, it was inevitable that I'd end up with a Weber 22.5"" Silver Kettle Grill!YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck. But I can't say it's really ever bothered me ALL that much! You'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals. But you already know that.While you'll get the hang of burgers, hot dogs, steaks, chicken and bratwurst right away, make sure to investigate ""indirect grilling"" where you pile your coals on one side or the other (or both) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you're grilling. Like a pork roast or a whole chicken. The 22.5"" Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you'd like to do. Including grilling a turkey! Easy to do plus incredible flavor!I recently acquired a ""slide-aside"" cradle for the lid which I like a lot,  and a clip-on tool holder, which is really handy. We use the grill several times a week. I've never found it lacking. There are a few techniques you'll pick up to turn out just what you like, such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking. You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you'll use for years and years to come. Get this larger size, but don't spend more on non-essentials. It's a zen thing. In place of a statue of Buddha, we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard. Grilling harkens back to caveman days, satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good. fire good. Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it's a neat thing to have when you need it. And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it doesn't ooze through the grate like you'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof. Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath (like a big metal bucket!) and you're in business. GREAT product! This is not a frivolous purchase, you NEED one of these!",5,Worth three times the price!
0,0,"So, I thought after fiddling with offset grills and barrel grills, it's time to try a kettle grill after all the hoopla from the UPS driver delivering all my other toys.  Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status.",5,it's time for a mad cook-em-up

3,4,"There are a lot of reviews on this already.  It is definatley a 5 star review.  I have had quite a few different weber products over the years, and this is just one more.  I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front. It is an easy fix, but easier to pay attention the first time.",5,NOT MUCH TO ADD
0,0,"I love this Weber One Touch Silver kettle. Seeing the kettles my relatives have, but made years earlier, i am pleased that years later, it still seems to be made with high quality steel, a good enamel and tight engineering. The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows ""Made in USA"" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says ""Assembled in USA"", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did.",5,Just like Dad's...maybe
2,3,"This grill has one major flaw.....surprised it is still being sold due to product liability. The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower.",1,"Big, Big, Fire Hazard...go for model with enclosed ash catcher"
2,2,"I had a Weber Kettle grill 20 years ago.  I had no clue what I was doing, but I still got great results.  Open the vents, put on the dome, and a little while later I had great food.  But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I'm doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of ""low and slow"" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won't smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you're a perfectionist, you'll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it's smaller it's harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don't wiggle.  But that's progress.  I don't think it's a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.  They have been building these forever, so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid, mutliple uses, food tastes great, easy to use.

159,166,"Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn't know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I'm sure you know what grill I'm talkin' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a ""real"" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it's just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn't seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it's possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn't make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it's just that it wasn't right, it's just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I've never had any problems with it, it's all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don't.There are good things however. First, it's just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin' on the good ol' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It's probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it's been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can't... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy's kettle. It wasn't a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though.

It is sleek, styling and iconic and I enjoy seeing it on my porch.- It is much more attractive than one of those monstrous gas grills.- It seals very tightly.- Its simple style allows you to cook many different meats in many different ways.- There are so many accessories available for it and they are easy to find.Now the bad. Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now.

What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've ""grown"" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum. This model gives extra space, an ash catcher, temp gauge, sliding lid and 2 side tables. However, my 18.5 is still going strong after 5 years of steady use and sitting in the elements.

Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However, ground squirrels are clever little critters.  Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that.  I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire. The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food. Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in (I use graham crackers)- it will stick to the wire and OSB (also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan).  Use a little stick if you have to, to mash it to the wire and OSB.  Another good bait are apple strips.  These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank.  The whole apple peel comes off in one strip.  This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan.  Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they can't just dangle half their body in, grab the food and leave without getting near the pan.",5,Tips for Squirrel Catching- 4 squirrels in 4 days!

Solidly constructed, pre-assembly out of the box was a positive.  The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food.  I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat.  I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again.  All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats, I couldn't believe there were that many in my neighborhood.  What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door, easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum's or groundhogs.  The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel.  Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price, this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it.  I've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night.  The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall, and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it.",5,Worked For Feral Cats...

We didn't know we caught one for a good portion of the day. Luckily it was a cooler day, so he/she was ok. Also make sure to weight the cage a bit, bc sometimes a moving cage will spook them back out of it.

An unadvertised benefit is that these have a ""built in alarm"" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly.",5,Works year after year

25,26,"We get a lot of mice when the weather turns cold.  I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes:- This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning.",5,Absolute best mouse trap if you don't like spring traps

Set them that evening, in the dark, using the technique advocated by other reviewers here... that is, gently tamped down a small section of a main, straight run until level with ground, cut grooves on either side for the trap jaws to sit in, set tap, and set trap down in grooves with the release lever sitting against the tamped-down ground.  One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I'm happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system. Will update if there is any more action, positive or negative.",5,Very effective!
4,4,"Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole.",5,Success In Five Hours
80,83,"This type of trap is highly effective IF you do NOT follow the directions about how to place it. If you bury it (which the directions will tell you to do) it will simply NOT work. If your ""out o sight"" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as ""Mark the Mole Man"") came to our house, I showed him our ""out of sight"" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, ""Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'."" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience.

But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes.

They have a stronger snap, but so far all I've come up with are sprung, empty traps.  The same bait is used for both traps (peanut butter).I don't care how mice are caught, as long as the job gets done.  This season, Victor Quick Set mouse traps are proven winners.

2,3,"Having been unable to create a method of capturing marauding mice and teleporting them unharmed to another galaxy, I resorted to a humane trap, intending to drive them several miles into the county and release them to find their county mouse cousins.  Alas and alack, the mice were able to enter the humane traps, retrieve the bait (peanut butter on a bit of cracker) and exit the traps with the bait.  Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese.

Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed.

Each of the patterns is distinct in its function and useful and something about the design allows great water pressure where you need it even if you have a well and lower pressure overall, as I do.The gentle shower pattern, a favorite for me, works really nicely with a nice overall spray and decent enough pressure to water the back of my 8' deep garden as effectively as the front.

Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months, so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning, though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.

37,40,"I had a cable driven long pruner, and besides the fact that it ... near broke my hand to clip a large branch with it, the thing was fragile.  I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw.

0,0,"These Fiskars 9210 Long-Handled Swivel Grass Shears will literally save wear and tear on your back and knees both when you have any small yard trimming to do. These are not made for grass trimming around the perimeter of a large yard, as your hand would wear out from squeezing the handle. We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it.

5,5,"Fiskars badly missed the target on this one.  Kudos to them for trying to fill the niche though, but in all honesty, this is almost as bad as having nothing at all.  Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4"" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version.",2,Poor execution

I've only had these for two years, but it's going strong.  I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).

3,3,"I've had this pruner for several years, and I've used it for a variety of tasks, including pruning roses and other bushes, to trimming off small tree branches. I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool.",4,"Very useful, very durable, and very comfortable"
1,1,When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them.,5,When I placed my order I had some doubts about this items quality.

It is very easy to use, light in weight but very solid construction and feel,  even makes cutting branches fun if you can believe that. I cut down twenty branches and three small trees in under a few minutes. I was looking around for more things to cut. Seems very well built. I can't think of a single thing that could have added on this thing to make it better Price is great. One reviewer gave it one star because the blade is curved so you have to open the tool's jaws slightly more. I am not sure but would bet the curved blade has something to do with just how easy this thing cuts. I have another cutter that doesn't have curved blades and it can't cut nowhere near as powerful as this tool. Tool is fantastic. Very Highly recommend Many Times over!!!

0,0,"There is power to spare with this lopper. Yes, it has to open very wide to get around the cutting target but if the space permits you to do so the cutting part is almost effortless. This is hands down the best lopper I have ever used as far as ease of cutting. When I finished clipping I decided to apply a bit of oil from the Fiskars Cutting Tool Care Kit that I had purchased. As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal. Other than the nick this is a top notch lopper.",4,They Have The Power

2,2,"I bought it in a local store on sale, for $29.99, mine is the same model, only 32"". Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2"" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2"".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25"" and 31"" instead of 32"".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!",5,Best lopper I've ever had!
2,3,"I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.

If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub, it was a big one.

Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.

I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10"" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I'm not a big guy (5'6""), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn't cut my leg off, but that's all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16"" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by ""choking up"" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat. I haven't truly put it through the paces yet, and I haven't had any (major) overstrikes, so I'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it.",5,Made it fun to split firewood.

1,1,"I've only been splitting wood for about 10 years, but in that time I've gone through 5 axes including this one. Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.",5,"The best splitting axe, hands-down."
0,0,"My old, heavy maul frequently got stuck in the piece of wood.  This one bounces out until it splits, eliminating the effort to pull it back out of the wood and getting it part way into position for the next stroke.  I can also split larger pieces of wood with it.",5,Bounces or Splits
0,0,"Never splitting wood before I went into this venture a bit nervous.  But I did end up splitting a 1/4 cord of wood from big logs rather easily.  I heard the trick was speed. However I found just the normal almost over the head with ""no extra push"" but having good control worked every time.  The bade did exhibit tiny chips, but I kept it sharpened as several recommended.  The price is great and it feels virtually impossible to break. Although I read some had broken the handle. I did over swing once but it did not seem to mark the handle. It did make me concentrate that much harder. I did find stepping back a half of step kept me from compensating as I bent coming forward. I am sure each person swing is a bit different.",5,Excellent Axe
0,0,"I've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand.  I've been through two different mauls, and this my friends, is the best I've used.  It's lighter, but it splits like a maul twice its weight.  I just wanted to try it out when I first got it, so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete.  All I can say is wow, I immediately went inside and ordered the 14"" and 8"" hatchets & fiskars sharpener.  I'm 6'4"" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet. I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design, it does not require the ""windup"" and force of the longer and heavier mauls.  Buy it.",5,Best Splitter I've used....

The axe blade is very sharp, and I have found that the Fiskars axe sharpener (Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener) works amazingly to resharpen the blade any time it seems to get dull.

2,3,"Amazons service was a great. Even though I used Supersaver they shipped it right out using UPS and I got it 3 days later. Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them. While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial. Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and  my tools are heavily used especially by the 'help' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks (Sweden), Vaughn (USA), Estwing (USA), Milwaukee (USA-electric saw), Silky Saws /cutting hatchets (Japan) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green. My  near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet. And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer. And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul. I checked the USA sources. No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now. So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find, if you know of one let me know. I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it. Glad I saved the head now.China  is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of 'cheating' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the ""opportunity' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer. And a sharp, well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade  go to China. People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed. It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you're taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business. Buy local. It is 'greener' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra....er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe, given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time,  but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor. And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks' axes from Sweden. So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class. They surely delivered. This is a superb tool!!This axe is very, very well balanced and designed,  as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot. It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really, really surprised me. So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day. The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man. The blade keeps its splitting edge well. Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless. The only problem is I don't get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless. You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone. I'm a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm. It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge. Truly amazing. Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise. This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head. Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe. I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever. Plastic is not good for the environment. You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace. Fiskar steel is better than average, not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class,  but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel. This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality. It is a great, great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you can't beat this splitting axe. For the homeowner or non professional  you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing don't make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA. This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many 'years' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters. But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour  maul and this splits better although Gransfours won't like to hear that. The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you don't want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them. I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world  this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds. It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts. I'm going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a 'perfect' design. They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe. I will  buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath. For the price you can't beat this tool and its made in  Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath. A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath. Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last. Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar. Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design. Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer. This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke. So Fiskar owed me as I don't take back tools I wear out. That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics. Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore.",5,Superb Axe-Best in the world for the Price

1,1,"I bought the 36 inch Fiskars Splitting Axe based on the great reviews of it here early in the Spring of 2013.  I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height (6 feet).  I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned.  I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target.  This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable.  I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out, you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly, and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this.  I sharpen it every hour or two of good use.  If I notice the wood isn't splitting well, I sharpen it again (it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood).  I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews, which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product.  I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started.  I cannot recommend this product enough!",5,The best wood splitter I have ever owned

0,0,"With a yard full of cut oak and a 20-year-old axe, progress was slow until this dimwit figured out he needed a new axe. After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17"" piece and an 11"" log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations.

Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long.

The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what.

Also, I don't see where anybody makes a side winding reel that is that much better than this one for the price at this time.",3,Can't take too much weight or bright sun
0,0,This is the second of theses reels I have purchased.  The first one broke after much use due to the stress and a heavy hose I had installed.  This time I purchased a much lighter weight hose and it works great.,4,Good Hose Reel
1,2,"I bought a STA100 at True Value Hardware this morning. It ran $23.99 + tax = $25.50. (With a store buyers card). It's slightly different than the one I replaced, requiring me to drill 3 new holes. Not an issue with me. Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING. IT'S NOW USELESS AND IN THE TRASH. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. OR AT LEAST DO NOT BUY ONE THAT MOUNTS ON A WALL. CHANGE MY RATING TO A 1 OR 2.",3,"Warped plastic, at-your-expense warranty."
7,7,"The fatal flaw with the design of this hose reel is that it can not support the weight of a 100' hose full of water. The first problem was that the wheel part wanted to separate from the spindle due to the weight of hose.  Finally the part you screw to the wall gave way and broke in half after about a year.  This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk.  I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price.  It looks like it will work forever.  Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8"" hose.  It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.  If I had it to do all over again, I would have purchased a quality reel the first time.",2,"Lasts for a few months, then breaks"
1,1,"I've had this for four years.  It leaked from day one.  Finally took it down to see if I could fix it.  The replacement part from Suncast costs 64 cents but the shipping is $9.50. On a 4 year old item, replacing the part doesn't make sense. Since this hose is right next to my front door, I have to have some sort of reel.  I'll look elsewhere.",2,LEAKS AND NO PARTS
4,4,"This stovetop smoker is amazing.  We currently own theChar Broil Silver Smokerand it take 5+ hours to smoke fish and meats.  The stovetop smoker can achieve the same results in about 30-40 minutes.  I love using different varietities of the smoking chips and foods come out tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Clean up is simple since I use foil to line the bottom of the drip pan.  All I have to do is toss out the smoking chips ashes, peel back the aluminum foil, give it a quick wash and rinse to get any moisture or any food splatter on the lid  and store it until the next use.  This unit does not fill your house with smoke but you can smell the wonderful aroma of cedar, apple, mesquite or whatever flavor of chips you use.Since I have a smooth top stove and do not want to scratch the surface, I use the stovetop smoker on top ofSanyo HPS-SG3 200-Square-Inch Electric Indoor Barbeque Grill, Blackand also use it on with myWeber 586002 Q 320 Portable Outdoor Gas Grill.  Using it on the Weber Grill gets slower cooking results but it is great to take to picnics and camping to smoke up those fish you catch!",5,Smoke your foods with less effort and less time
3,3,"This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker, I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!",5,One of the best products I have ever had!

195,200,"I lived in a condo for years and really missed cooking outdoors and the tremendous flavor of food slow smoked in a smoker.  I bought this awhile ago and have been pretty happy with it.  It's stainless steel, durable and comes with samples of 4 different types of wood chips. You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com. I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off. It's a closed unit so virtually all of the smoke stays inside.  If there is a problem with smoke escaping, the instructions include tips on how to correct the problem.  Usually, the lid just needs a little tweaking.I think the first thing I smoked in it was salmon and let me tell you it was delicious! I have also smoked chicken, turkey wings, sweet potatoes, potatoes, shrimp, burgers, and cheese all with excellent results.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time. The chicken doesn't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it.  If it's smoke flavor you are after, this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking!Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray.  Also if you line the base of the smoker and the drip pan with aluminum foil all you have to do is let it cool completely and dump the foil in the trash.  This will help to keep your pans from getting black and shortens clean up time.",5,Great for Indoor Smoking
233,240,"I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years, and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts, and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender, and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food, and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked, but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds, but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker.",5,Amazing results!
1,1,"Used once and really like it. I smoked whole chicken, but I cut chicken in half and smoked about 1.5 hours on lower heat. The chips birned, so next time I would add more chips. I did have to finish chicket (to add some crispiness) in the oven for 10 min. The chicken came out excellent, best chicken I ever cooked. With chicken smoked potato and came out very nice as well with delicate flavor of smoke. Also, I considered as a bonus the aroma of smoked wood that fill out my house, loved it. It was not strong, but flavorful. Highly recommend this product.",5,Like it a lot
22,22,"I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black, rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking, the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish, steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g., hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food, while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!",5,Excellent Grill in a Smartly Designed Package
1,1,"I've owned the Char-Broil Patio Caddie for quite a few years and I am currently on my 2nd grill.  For those looking for a compact grill to use on a small patio or balcony, I believe that this is the best grill that you'll find.I'm not sure if the other reviews mention this or not, but this grill does accept a full-size propane cannister, so you can just swap it out at your local drug or hardware store when it's empty.  My grill did come with the smaller cannister, but I bought it quite awhile ago, so perhaps they no longer do.  If yours doesn't, it's no great loss, in my view, because once again, I've never used the smaller cannister.  Just get yourself a full-sized one and it will last a lot longer.The temperature gauge seems very accurate and the grill is quite durable. I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use.  I'd definitely recommend it and I'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well.",5,The best propane grill for small areas
9,9,"This is a perfect grill for small groups.  I typically only grill for my wife and I so the size is perfect.  It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars.",4,"Good, but not Great"
1,1,I bought this a replacement for one exactly like it.  The old one finally was put to rest after many years of use by my parents.  This compact grill is easy to use and uses up very little space.  Perfect for a small deck.  Great construction and easy set up.  The one drawback was that the new grill did not come with the two side tables that the original grill had. I took them off the old grill and installed them on the new one.,4,Great compact grill
1,1,"I love this grill, it is deceptively small from the outside. You can probably fit 8-10 burgers on it. It takes up a third of the space as my old ""Grill 2 Go"" portable grill. It has an attractive dark green finish. As others have said, it heats evenly unlike most grills which focus the heat along the burner.The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because Amazon (and the Char Broil) site lists it as having a propane tank included. From reading the Amazon description and some other reviewers comments, it should've come with a smaller propane tank. According to the Char Broil site there should be a 20 pound tank. I sent Amazon an email followed by a phone call, and they stated that there should've been a tank, so they immediately sent me a new grill, had it the next day, great customer service! But this one, like the first box said on the outside ""LP tank not included."" I called Amazon now, and the rep agreed that there should be a tank, and sending a third unit would be pointless as it would probably not have a tank. Amazon offered me a $30 refund to cover the cost of a 20 pound tank purchased locally, which was an acceptable resolution.",3,Great grill be forewarned though

We had a major Yellowjacket problem and I went to 4 stores...all of which were out of this trap.

Finally the 5th place I stopped had just restocked and their shelves were full...and yes, there were 2 people already picking them up when I arrived.Come home, put the solution on the cotton ball and by the end of the first 12 hours, we had caught 13 yellowjackets.

Other wasps and hornets are attracted to the activity but they like fresh meat/bugs. Fly catchers (stinky bags) attract hornets and wasps to the live bugs. I have used these for many years. Use these units with the larger 10 week cartridge, and place the small pack bait (available at Amazon) on it when it gets weak, reuse with this type of cheaper bait in the larger cartridge each year, but check that there are no webs covering the bottom holes and/or internal cone hole, or YJ's will leave. It works very well to catch queens looking to build nests in April, and keep them out until Sept. to get workers of queens that were missed. Very effective. Move to another location if no luck in 2 weeks, or if very few are caught. Load indoors or after sunset, or you might get stung. Hint, this old fish smell works well in the spring, sweet attractant works better before hybernation in the fall in a different type of catcher; one you can put juice, beer, or other sweet attractant, with a drop of soap, recharge with water but add a drop of non-fragrant dish soap as it evaporates.",5,Excellent
